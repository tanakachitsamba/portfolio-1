			<div class="title c">
				I'm a data and AI engineer with a background in data science, analytics, and problem-solving with real-world impact. I work on building systems that turn complex data into something clear and useful, whether it’s powering automation, helping people make better decisions 📊, or exploring patterns 🔍 to understand what’s really going on.

				Before working in data, I co-founded a business 🚀 and spent several years as a UX/UI designer 🎨 and web developer. That experience still shapes how I work today. I think about how systems are actually used, how to make them intuitive, and how to keep the human side of technology in focus.

				I’m especially interested in the ethical and environmental sides of data — how we collect it, how we use it responsibly, and how to reduce the footprint of the infrastructure behind it 🌱. I'm drawn to projects that are thoughtful, well-built, and grounded in real value.

			<div class="d">
				I developed a prototype for an AI-powered gardening app, it harnesses the power of OpenAI's
				Language Model (LLM) API to provide users with information about growing plants. The core
				objective of this project revolves around the creation of an intelligent assistance platform
				that empowers gardeners with expert support and assistance across a wide range of growing
				tasks. The Data Science project report coming soon.
